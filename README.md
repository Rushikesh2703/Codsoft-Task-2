Movie Rating Prediction using Data Science 

This project focuses on utilizing data science and machine learning techniques to predict the ratings of movies.
By analyzing a dataset that includes features like genre, director, cast, and budget, we aim to develop a predictive model that 
can provide insights into the potential success of a film in terms of audience ratings. Overview Understanding what makes a movie successful,
in terms of audience ratings, can be a complex task. By applying data science methodologies, we seek to unravel the factors that contribute to the
rating of a film. This project offers valuable insights for movie enthusiasts, filmmakers, and anyone interested in the movie industry.
